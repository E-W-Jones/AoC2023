# Further Optimizations
- [x] Day 4: Don't brute force through all cards on task 2
- [ ] Day 5: Find a better solution for task 2 (runs in ~1:29)
- [ ] Day 6: Vectorize w/ numpy
- [ ] Day 9: Is there a way to remove the need for lists on part 2?
- [ ] Day 16: Currently takes 11 cpu hours to run. I have no idea why mine takes so much longer. Could be that I'm copying the entire list for a beam? Moving around all that memory would be annoying. As far as I'm aware, I'm bailing out at the first possible instance.
- [ ] Day 17: ... Pathfinding is not my strong suite.
- [ ] Day 20: Convince myself the part 2 logic makes sense
- [ ] Day 22: Can we drop the bricks faster?
- [ ] Day 23: Currently could be simulating each sub_path more than once, cutting back would be useful
